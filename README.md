# Spring Library

A library book borrowing management system where citizens can freely borrow and return books,
and change their borrowing and returning statuses themselves.
Citizens can register their own accounts and check the relevant information of books.
They can borrow and return books.
We assume that every citizen is a responsible citizen who takes good care of books.
They will not borrow books but fail to perform the borrowing registration operation.
